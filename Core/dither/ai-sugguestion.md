>>> Please create a simple image dithering function using Rust

Here is an example of a simple image dithering function in Rust that  
uses the `image` crate:

```
use image::{ImageBuffer, Rgb};

fn dither(img: &mut ImageBuffer<Rgb<u8>, Vec<u8>>) {
    // Dither the image using a 2x2 Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion
matrix
    let mut errors = [[0, 0], [0, 0]];

    for (x, y, pixel) in img.pixels_mut() {
        let err = pixel[0] / 16;
        errors[x % 2][y % 2] += err;
        pixel[0] = if errors[x % 2][y % 2] >= 8 { 255 } else { 0 };
    }
}
```

This function takes an `ImageBuffer` as input and modifies it in place  
by dithering the image using a 2x2 Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion  
matrix. The `errors` variable is used to keep track of the error values  
for each pixel, and the `pixel[0]` value is set to either 0 or 255 based on whether the error is greater than or equal to 8.  

To use this function, you can simply pass an image buffer as an argument:  

```
let mut img = ImageBuffer::<Rgb<u8>, Vec<u8>>::new(100, 100);
dither(&mut img);
```

This will dither the `img` variable in place and modify it to have a dithered image. You can then use the modified image buffer for further processing or display.  

Note that this is just an example function and may not be suitable for all images or use cases. It's important to carefully consider the specific requirements of your application and
choose the appropriate dithering algorithm and parameters for your needs.
